 # Lint Dependencies Fix Rule

## Description
This rule automatically suggests running the dependency linter fix command when there are forbidden source dependency errors.

## When to use
When there are linter errors containing "forbidden source dependency" in the error message.

## Example error messages
```
forbidden source dependency src/pages/admin_feature_control/experiment_view/version_view/enrolments -> src/ui/base/typography ../../../../../ui/base/typography
```

## Solution
Run the dependency linter fix command for the affected directory:

```bash
pnpm lint:deps:fix <directory>
```

Where `<directory>` is the root directory containing the file with the dependency error (typically the highest common directory path).

## Example
If you have a file at `src/pages/admin_feature_control/experiment_view/version_view/enrolments/SampleComponentFile.tsx` with a forbidden source dependency error, run:

```bash
pnpm lint:deps:fix src/pages/admin_feature_control
```

This will fix dependency issues for all files under the `admin_feature_control` directory.
